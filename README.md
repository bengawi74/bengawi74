About Me

Hi, I started my career in finance and operations, working for many years in budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. Recently, I shifted my focus toward applied data and AI to combine my business background with modern analytical tools. I am building skills in data analytics, model development, and full-stack data applications, with hands-on work in machine learning, deep learning, and practical problem-solving. My goal is to move into a role that connects business understanding with data-driven insights. I am also preparing for the MMAI program at the Schulich School of Business.

# Anwar Ali

Finance and operations leader moving into applied data and AI.  
I spent many years in budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. Now I am building systems that use data and machine learning to explain what is happening in a business and what should happen next.

I am currently finishing the Applied AI Solutions Development program at George Brown College and preparing an application for the Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence (MMAI) at the Schulich School of Business.

## Selected projects

### Data Analytics Portfolio  
Repository: https://github.com/bengawi74/data-analytics-portfolio  

Small portfolio of early analytics work.  
Includes data extraction from CSV and JSON, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and a first classical ML model (logistic regression). These projects formed the base for later deep learning and full-stack work.

---

### YOLOv5 Grocery Object Detection  
Repository: https://github.com/bengawi74/yolov5-grocery-detection  

Computer vision project that detects grocery items on shelves using YOLOv5.  
Covers dataset preparation, training, and evaluation with metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP, plus saved weights and example detection outputs.

---

### Fabric Classification with EfficientNet and Streamlit  
Repository: https://github.com/bengawi74/fabric-efficientnet-streamlit  

Image classification system that predicts fabric type from clothing photos (cotton, denim, leather, linen, polyester, silk).  
Uses EfficientNet for training and serves a simple Streamlit app so a user can upload an image and see the predicted fabric type.

---

### Full-Stack Sentiment Analysis System  
Repository: https://github.com/bengawi74/sentiment-fullstack-project  

Backend built with FastAPI and a frontend dashboard built with Streamlit.  
Collects and analyzes text comments from sources such as YouTube and Amazon, applies a sentiment model, and shows results through charts and tables. Designed as a graded full-stack data science systems project.

---

### Supervised Learning – Regression (Titanic example)  
Repository: https://github.com/bengawi74/supervised-learning-regression  

Classical machine learning project using logistic regression on the Titanic dataset.  
Focuses on clean feature preparation, train/test split, evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall and F1, plus a short written summary.

---

## Education and background

- Bachelor’s degree in Economics.  
- Nineteen years of experience in accounting and corporate finance, including budgeting, forecasting, consolidation, and financial reporting.  
- Graduate certificate in Applied AI Solutions Development at George Brown College (in progress).  
- Preparing for the MMAI program at the Schulich School of Business.
