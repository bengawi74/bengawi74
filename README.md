##  Selected Projects

###  Grocery Items Object Detection (YOLOv5)
Multi-class object detection model trained on grocery shelf images.

- Detects multiple product types per image (e.g., cans, bottles, boxes)
- Implemented with **YOLOv5**, trained and evaluated on **Kaggle**
- Includes mAP metrics, confusion matrix, and visualized predictions

> Tech: Python, PyTorch, YOLOv5, Jupyter, Kaggle

---

###  Fabric Classification for Clothing
End-to-end image classification system to identify **fabric type, color group, and garment type**.

- Used **EfficientNet** and **ConvNeXt** backbones
- Built a **multi-stage pipeline** for fabric type + color + garment
- Includes Streamlit demo and detailed evaluation report

> Tech: PyTorch, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Streamlit

---

###  Social Sentiment Intelligence (Text Project)
Full-stack style project that analyzes text comments from different platforms (e.g., YouTube, Amazon) to help product owners understand what people are saying about their products.

- Cleans and preprocesses raw text
- Trains multiple models: Logistic Regression, Feed-Forward NN, LSTM, and a Transformer-based model
- Outputs sentiment predictions and simple visualizations

> Tech: Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Transformers, Streamlit

##  Background in Finance

Before AI, I spent almost **two decades in accounting and corporate finance**, working on:

- Budgeting, forecasting, and financial analysis  
- Management reporting and dashboards  
- ERP implementations and process improvements  

Now I’m combining that experience with machine learning to build **data-driven tools for better business decisions**.
