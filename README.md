👋 About Me
I started my career in finance and operations, working for many years in budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. Recently, I shifted my focus to applied data and AI to combine my business background with modern analytical tools.
I’m currently developing skills in:
Data analytics and visualization
Machine learning and model development
Deep learning for vision and language tasks
Full-stack data applications
My goal is to work in a role that connects business understanding with AI-driven insights.
I am also preparing for the MMAI program at Schulich School of Business.
